# scenesurfaces
This library contains code to compute features related to 3D scene structure from surface normal and distance images. Depending on the parameters used for the main function, this code can compute distance features, surface orientation features, or features that quantify both surface distance and orientation. See examples in the repository for usage. Please cite Lescroart & Gallant, 2018 if you use this code in your research.
